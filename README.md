# PythonBreakout
## Day 86 of 100 Days of Python Code
### Author: John Cupak

In creating this game using Python and Turtle graphics, I had a brick wall (pun intended) when creating the individual bricks until I understood that each brick was a turtle. I originally tried to make the padde and the bricks and the ball each a class, but decided to put all the code in the main.py and left the scoreboard.py as its own class. Added a sound file which plays whenever the ball hits the paddle.
